# Contribution Guidelines ðŸ“š

Welcome to our project! We appreciate your interest and contributions. Please read the following guidelines carefully to ensure a smooth collaboration.

## General Rules:

- **Creativity Allowed:** Feel free to submit pull requests that break the rulesâ€”we might just merge them anyway!
- **No Build Steps:** Avoid adding build steps like `npm install` to maintain simplicity as a static site.
- **Preserve Existing Content:** Do not remove existing content.
- **Code Style:** Your code can be neat, messy, simple, or complex. As long as it works, it's welcome.
- **Add Your Name:** Remember to add your name to the `contributorsList` file.
- **Keep it Small:** Aim for small pull requests to minimize merge conflicts and streamline reviews.

## Getting Started ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤—

1. **Fork the Repository:**

   - Use the fork button at the top right of the repository page.

2. **Clone Your Fork:**

   - Clone the forked repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fineanmol/Hacktoberfest2024.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

4. **Create a New Branch:**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-new-branch
   ```

5. **Make Your Changes:**

   - Add your name to `contributors/contributorsList.js` and make any other contributions.

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

6. **Commit Your Changes:**

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Relevant message"
   ```

7. **Push to Your Branch:**

8. **Create a Pull Request:**
   - Go to your forked repository on GitHub and create a pull request to the main repository.

## Avoiding Conflicts {Syncing Your Fork}

To keep your fork up-to-date with the main repository and avoid conflicts:

1. **Add Upstream Remote:**

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/abhinavtyagi88/tour-and-travel.git
   ```

2. **Verify the New Remote:**

   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

3. **Sync Your Fork with Upstream:**

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

   This will pull in changes from the parent repository and help you resolve any conflicts.

4. **Keep Updated:**

   - Regularly pull changes from the upstream repository to keep your fork updated.

5. **Add your name to this file before pull request**
